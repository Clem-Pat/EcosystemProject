# Ecosystem Game

The Ecosystem game is a small simulation of the evolution of a group of frogs and flies evolving within the same ecosystem called the Pond. 

The rules are simple : 
- The frogs try to eat the nearest fly by throwing its tongue before starving to death. If it's close enough and its tongue speed is greater than the fly's speed, it can eat it successfully. 
- The flies fly randomly except when they feel a frog trying to eat them. In that case, they try to flee. 
- The fox is controlled by the user with the keyboard arrows. It needs to eat the frogs before starvation without being stung by the flies.
